" Perfect for our 3 year old! Don’t know why it’s packaged the way it is as others have mentioned. But once she’s out, ours stood up fine and hair looks good! "
 I bought this for my daughter and the same day it came out of the package the hair had knots that could barely be brushed out. I ended up just putting the hair in a braid but just be prepared for this to happen. Overall it's a really nice toy besides the hair being unmanageable.
 We purchased this for our year and a half old granddaughter. It was a perfect size  not too big
 I absolutely love this doll. I got it for the kids I babysit. Im really glad there are many to choose from. However there are other princesses that are missing from the collection and I really wish they had dolls as well. Such as:- Merida- Raya- Esmeralda- Jane Porter (Tarzan)- Megara (Hercules)- Tinkerbell- Elsa- Anna- Anastasia- Kida (Atlantis)- Elena- Alice (Alice in wonderland)And I know this one isnt exactly a Disney movie
 It was a christmas present for my 4 year old granddaughter. It was the one thing she wanted.
I can’t really complain because I was able to get a Rapunzel doll
 It was so cute. Looked well made the dress is so cute
 Well well
 Don't know much about it only my granddaughter wanted one for Christmas . Good price compared to other local sources. 
 Pretty doll..Added her to my grand daughters princess collection of dolls. 
 bought for christmas as a santa gift and my 5 year old couldnt love this moana doll more! 
 Asked to rate this on “thickness” 10/10 for that question. But the doll is beautiful! My niece is going to love her
 Packaging was great and worth the money” 
 It's a really beautiful doll! The appearance it's just like the movie. I love the quality overall and the hair in particular is so pretty! I'm very happy with this purchase. Only thing I didn't like was the un boxing experience
 Very good deal. Its cute pretty
 I bought this for my granddaughter's 4th birthday. She absolutely loved her new baby doll! The doll was beautiful - well made - and the colors for the dress were bright and it was also well made. 
 The doll's box was quite broken when it arrived. (Just want to let Amazon know) Fortunately the doll was in perfect shape. She's what I hoped for. Before long hair
 Se ve resistente. Es muy linda. Mi hijo la escogió para regalo de cumpleaños de su hermana y le gustó. Creo que él hizo una buena elección. 
 Granddaughter loves her so much. Carries her everywhere. She is a huge Moana fan. 
 She’s THE perfect addition to our daughters collection!! Since we watch Moana EVERY. SINGLE. DAY!! it’s important to have her be apart of our family too!!TOTALLY worth the money!! She’s very durable and sturdy with all the “playing” she does with our daughter!! 
 so pretty the box came a little bit damaged in the corner
 This doll has a different finish on the eyes most of them have eyes designed with paint
 Gorgeous doll! the details are cute  I just wish it came with something else for the price but overall my 2 1/2 year old loves it and she’s pretty sturdy . She can sit and stand 
 My 5 year old granddaughter is obsessed with Aurora and this was the perfect gift for her. It's her new favorite doll. Good value for the price. Arrived on time and in perfect condition. 
 This is the exact doll I have been looking for since last year when my daughter's went missing. Great quality. Fast shipping and packaged so well not a single issue with product 
 My 2 year old granddaughter loved this doll. Well made. Size matched the Rapunzel doll I bought at Costco for my other 7 year old granddaughter

 This doll is by I hope my grand daughter will live it as much as I do
 The doll is great  but the doll was packed with books that dented the packaging. Using a gift with a dented package is not optimal.
